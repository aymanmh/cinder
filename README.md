# cinder samples

various c++ cinder projects mostly following Shiffman's coding challenges (https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/videos).

NOTE: you have to link to cinder framework for these to compile, the framework files are not parts of this repository (or generate an project with TinderBox and copy the code from here)
